## icx-asset sync

```

## icx-asset ls

## icx-asset upload

Usage: `icx-asset upload [<key>=]<file> [[<key>=]<file> ...]`

Examples:

```
# upload a single file as /a.txt

# upload a single file, a.txt, under another name
$ icx-asset upload /b.txt=a.txt

# upload a directory and its contents as /some-dir/*
$ icx-asset upload some-dir

# Similar to synchronization with dfx deploy, but without deleting anything:
$ icx-asset upload /=src/<project>/assets
