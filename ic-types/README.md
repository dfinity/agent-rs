# IC Types

## Goal
This library contains typings and utility functions dealing with the Public specification of the Internet Computer and the HTTP client. It might be shared in the future but for now is separated for the purpose of testing and development.

## Running Tests
Regular tests can be run by anyone using `cargo test`. This will not run a special version of the tests that runs against a server implementation of the public specification, though those tests can be run against a compatible Replica.
