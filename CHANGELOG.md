## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.1] - 2022-01-10

The `lookup_value` function now takes generics which can be iterated over (`IntoIterator<Item = &'p Label>`)  and transformed into a `Vec<Label>`, rather than just a `Vec<Label>`.

## [0.11.0] - 2022-01-07

### Breaking change: Updated to ic-types 0.3.0

The `lookup_path` method now takes an `Iterator<Label>` rather than an `AsRef<[Label]>`

## [0.10.2] - 2021-12-22

### ic-agent

Added support for upgrading HTTP requests (http_request_update method)

## [0.10.1] - 2021-12-10

Updated crate dependencies, most notably updating rustls,
removing the direct dependency on webpki-roots, and allowing
consumers of ic-agent to update to reqwest 0.11.7.

### ic-agent

#### Added: read_state_canister_metadata

Implements https://github.com/dfinity-lab/ic-ref/pull/371

### ic-asset

#### Fixed: sync and upload will now attempt retries as expected

Fixed a defect in asset synchronization where no retries would be attempted after the first 30 seconds overall.

### icx-asset

#### Fixed: now works with secp256k1 .pem files.

## [0.10.0] - 2021-11-15

Unified all version numbers and removed the zzz-release tool.

### ic-agent

#### Fixed: rewrite all *.ic0.app domains to ic0.app to avoid redirects.

### icx-cert

#### New feature: Add --accept-encoding parameter

It's now possible to specify which encodings will be accepted.  The default (and previous) behavior
is to accept only the identity encoding.  Specifying encodings that browsers more commonly accept
demonstrates the difference in the returned data and certificate.

For example, here is the data and certificate returned when only accepting the identity encoding.

```
$ cargo run -p icx-cert -- print 'http://localhost:8000/index.js?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai'
DATA HASH: 1495cd574831c23b4db97bc3860666ea495386f0ef0dab73c23ef31db5aa2765
    Label("/index.js", Leaf(0x1495cd574831c23b4db97bc3860666ea495386f0ef0dab73c23ef31db5aa2765)),
```

Here is an example accepting the gzip encoding (as most browsers do), showing that the canister
responded with different data having a different data hash.

```
$ cargo run -p icx-cert -- print --accept-encoding gzip 'http://localhost:8000/index.js?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai'
DATA HASH: 1770e76af0816ba951320c03eab1263c43de7ac4b0558dd9049cc532b7d6cd01
    Label("/index.js", Leaf(0x1495cd574831c23b4db97bc3860666ea495386f0ef0dab73c23ef31db5aa2765)),
```
